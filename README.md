# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to use existing data to create a chart showing the total fare-revenue generated on a weekly basis by each of the three demographic areas (urban, suburban, and rural). This information will help PyBer decision-makers gain a better understanding on where the majority of their revenue is coming from and to discern any potential trends within the defined timeframe.

## Results
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

Over the observed time period, PyBer had a total of 2,375 rides by 2,973 drivers for a total of $63,538.64 in fares. The average fare per ride was $26.75 and the average fare per driver was $21.37. 

### Urban Areas
Urban areas accounted for 1,625 rides, 2,405 drivers, and generated $39,854.38 in revenue. Urban also areas observed the lowest average revenue per ride at $24.53 and generated $16.57 average per ride for each driver. This represents an 8.3% discount over the average cost per ride across all three city types and a 22.46% discount over the average ride per driver. Urban areas generate by far the most activity. Urban areas comprised 68.42% of the total rides, 80.89% of all drivers, and 62.27% of all fares. The urban areas are where the majority of the revenue is currently generated, but it appears the market might be reaching a saturation point. 

### Suburban Areas 
Suburban areas accounted for 625 rides, 490 drivers, and generated $19,356.33 in revenue. Suburban areas also saw the second most average revenue per rode at $30.97 and generated $39.50 average per ride for each driver. This represents a 15.78 % premium over the average cost per ride across all three city types and an 84.84% premium over the average ride per driver. These premiums are slightly skewed though because of the moderate activity in suburban areas; suburban areas only comprised 26.32% of the total rides, 16.48% of all drivers, and 30.46% of all fares. The suburban areas is could be important to the company moving forward as they will probably account for a large percentage of future growth. 

### Rural Areas
Rural areas accounted for 125 rides, 78 drivers, and generated $4,327.93 in revenue. Rural areas also observed the highest average revenue per ride at $34.62 and generated $55.49 average per ride for each driver. This represents a 29% premium over the average cost per ride across all three city types and a 159.66% premium over the average ride per driver.  The headline numbers are skewed by the low activity in rural areas; rural areas only comprised 5.26% of the total rides, 2.62% of all drivers, and 6.81% of all fares. In summary, activity in rural areas is peripheral to the company.   

### Total Fares, Drivers, Revenue per Trip and Driver

## Summary
Based on the analysis, I have three recommendations as to improve the business.

### Collect information for a profitability analysis.
The available data does not allow us to properly measure productivity and per ride profitability. We could determine the driverâ€™s productivity if the data set included trip length or duration and profit (either per mile or per minute). Per minute would be preferable as this would allow the data to be more comparable between urban and rural areas. It currently appears that rural trips are more profitable, but that might not be the case if the rides are 5 times longer than the average urban trip but only generates 39% more revenue.

### Grow PyBer's Suburban and Rural Presence.
The average cost per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than the average for both categories. This high average cost per ride is probably a good indicator that there is unmet demand in these areas that could offer PyBer growth opportunities in the future. Expansion to meet unmet demand could help keep the company growing as it reaches a potential saturation point in the urban areas. PyBer should be cautious about rapid expansion in these areas though, especially rural areas, as their current share of the market and absolute numbers are both much lower than the urban areas. Rapid expansion might quickly oversaturate the market and drive fares, and profits, down. 

### Identify ways to reduce Urban driver headcount
Urban drivers comprise 80.89% of the driver headcount and only generate 68.42% of revenue. Unless the profitability analysis (first recommendation) indicates these drivers have high profitability, it appears to me that the market is oversaturated with drivers and is keeping fares suppressed. PyBer could address this issue by reducing driver headcount which should reduce supply of rides and increase average fare per ride and average fare per driver, thus increasing overall profitability.
